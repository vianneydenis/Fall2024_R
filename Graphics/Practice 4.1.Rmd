<p class="alert">
**`r knitr::asis_output("\U26A0")` Practice 4.1** Using the `iris` dataset, reproduce the plot below. **Explore** the function `pairs` allowing to generate a matrix of scatter plots between variables `pairs (iris[1:4])`. You will send me a **pdf** file of the plot your made. You can also add your code into a *.Rmd* in which you will import your image and knit it in a *.html* file. You will email me [vianneydenis@g.ntu.edu.tw] your files (and/or link) **before next Monday** so that I can review your work. The **title of your email** should be: `Practice 4.1 (your name: your student no.). ENJOY ;)
